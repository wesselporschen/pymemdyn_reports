# Analysis of protein-ligand complex insertion into lipid bilayer membrane system with PyMemDyn

In this repository, the output generated by the insertion of 6 GPCR protein-ligand complexes into a POPC lipid bilayer membrane with PyMemDyn are analyzed. 

The 6 GPCR structures (+ co-crystallized ligands) that were inserted using PyMemDyn were:
1. 5OLZ (adenosine A2Ar)
2. 4S0V (OX2)
3. 4XNV (P2Y1)
4. 2RH1 (beta 2 adrenergic receptor)
5. 4EIY (adenosine A2Ar)
6. 5OLO (adenosine A2Ar)

## Files and directories

- `pymemdyn_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook which contains the analysis.
- `inputdata`: directory containing 1) the input files used for the PyMemDyn membrane insertion for each protein-ligand complex (see `files.md` and `pdb_file_processing.md` for more information about these files and how each protein structure was acquired and processed), and well as 2) the total compressed output generated by PyMemDyn during each MD run (`MD_output.tgz`).
- `reports`: directory containing the 'reports' generated by PyMemDyn, accessed by the Jupyter notebook.

## TO-DO
1. discussion of 2 remaining RMSF outliers after manual inspection of trajectories in pymol
2. overall discussion / conclusion about confidence in generated structure, implications of RMSF on MD simulations, etc.
